# <Horiseon-Refactor>

## Description

Horiseon Social Solutions came to our company Devel-Op Web Services to update, maintain, and refactor their main advertising frontpage. Devel-Op followed semantic HTML, concise syntax, and Agile methodology. We were able to help Horiseon fix broken attribute connections and allow webpage guests to seemlessly browse the webpage and for information about Horiseon. Devel-Op Web Services increased search engine optimization of Horiseon while maintaining the same professional look and care. During our refactoring, we learned the importance of ARIA, Agile, semantic HTML, non-repetitive source code, and strong team communication whilst maintaining professional communications with Horiseon. The client expressed their satisfaction and continued patronage.
